Dr Claus Jorgensen and his team at the Institute of Cancer Research are studying the way pancreatic cancer cells communicate with the healthy cells surrounding them. His primary research interest is to understand aberrant cellular signalling networks in pancreatic cancer and in particular how the tumour microenvironment affects malignant progression and therapeutic response. Using a combination of *in vivo* and *in vitro* models, the Jorgensen laboratory focuses on quantitative and cell-specific proteomic mining to generate testable hypotheses of interdependencies between tumour and host. Utilising these models, the aim is to identify therapeutic targets.
