Professor Andrew Biankin is a surgeon specialising in the treatment of pancreatic disease. He is also a scientific researcher with a primary focus on the molecular pathology of pancreatic cancer, the development of early detection and novel therapeutic strategies based on molecular phenotyping and the delineation and implementation of biomarkers that facilitate clinical decision making. He contributes to the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) through extensively characterising the genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic aberrations in pancreatic cancer, and is extending this knowledge to a personalized model of cancer care, where molecular characteristics guide treatment decisions. Although having recently relocated to Scotland, he continues to co-lead the Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative, a network of hospitals and research institutions throughout Australia.
