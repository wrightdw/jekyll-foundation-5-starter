        Pancreatic cancer is currently the 4th leading cause of cancer death in Western societies, and is predicted to be the 2nd leading cause within a decade. There has been little improvement in patient outcomes over the last half century.

PRECISION-Panc is a new initiative, launching in 2015, which aims to accelerate scientific discovery. We will identify new treatment options for the 8,000 or so people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the UK each year.
