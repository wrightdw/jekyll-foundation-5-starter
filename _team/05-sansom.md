Professor Owen Sansom‘s research focus is to understand how tumourigenesis is provoked by the driver oncogene and tumour suppressor mutations in epithelial cancer and how those mutations affect drug response, in order to identify novel markers of disease as well as new targets for therapy. A crucial component of his research is to analyse these changes in 3D model systems that incorporate the tumour microenvironment, using mouse models that faithfully recapitulate human diseases. The group’s work on pancreatic cancer is focussed on the use of genetically engineered mouse models of cancer to stratify patient therapy and to determine how combinatorial therapies targeting both the tumour and stroma may lead to better therapies.
