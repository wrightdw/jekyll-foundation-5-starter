Dr Jennifer Mortonâ€˜s key research aims are:

- to profile different genetic subsets of pancreatic cancer to better understand the disease and to target specific molecules for therapy, thus improving improve treatment options for patients
- to use mouse models to determine the importance of genetic events found to be prognostic indicators in human tumours
- to perform pre-clinical trials of novel targeted therapies in clinically relevant mouse models of pancreatic cancer

Recently, she has studied the use of the drug rapamycin to arrest tumour growth in mice with a faulty PTEN gene. This gene is also found to be faulty in about 1 in 5 human pancreatic cancer patients, indicating a potential strategy for personalised treatment of these patients.
