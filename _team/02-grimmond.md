Professor Sean Grimmond's research focuses on interrogating the transcriptomes, genomes and epigenomes of solid tumours and then defining the underlying genetics that control biological processes and pathological states. He has led Australiaâ€™s contribution to the International Cancer Genome Consortium, in an effort to sequence 350 pancreatic and ovarian tumours and their matched normal samples. His research in Glasgow focuses on systems-based analysis of cancer and testing the clinical utility of genomics in healthcare:

- development of rapid diagnostic whole genome sequencing for personalised cancer care
- continued mapping of the mutational landscapes of pancreatic and ovarian cancer with ICGC
- investigating the clinical utility of new druggable targets in pancreatic cancer
