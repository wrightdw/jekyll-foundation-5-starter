Professor Duncan Jodrell and his team are turning laboratory discoveries into improved treatments for a range of cancers, including pancreatic cancer. His preclinical research focuses on model systems of pancreatic cancer, developing 2D and 3D co-culture models as the initial testing platforms for novel therapeutics. He also leads a specialist clinic for patients with pancreatic cancer. He collaborates closely with imaging specialists in both the Cambridge Institute and Addenbrookes Hospital, incorporating novel molecular imaging approaches into experimental medicine studies, to facilitate the discovery, preclinical and clinical development of novel anti-cancer drugs, in truly 'bench to bedside' translational research.
