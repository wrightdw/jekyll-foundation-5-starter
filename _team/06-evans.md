Professor Jeff Evans' research focus is the development of novel laboratory models to determine the biological function of key tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes in vivo, in both normal tissues and tumours. This will allow the identification and characterisation of the signalling pathways that are deregulated at the early stages of pancreatic cancer as well as in the invasive and metastatic disease. The models will also be used to determine how novel anticancer agents might best be evaluated in subsequent clinical trials. Biomarkers for anti-tumour activity of specific agents will be defined, so that can these may be detected in biological samples collected from patients in clinical trials.
