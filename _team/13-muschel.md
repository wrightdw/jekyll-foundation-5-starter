Professor Ruth Muschel and her research group are studying the mechanisms underlying the development of metastasis. Despite surgery and/or radiation, many cancer patients, who appear to have localised disease, go on to develop distant metastases. Fluorescent microscopy has been used to define the process of metastasis. The research aims to elucidate the mechanisms tumour cells use to arrest and survive at different metastatic organs, how tumor cells interact with the host vasculature during metastasis, the mechanisms of metastasis to different organs and the effects of irradiation on metastasis.
