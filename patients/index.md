##Patient Information

###What is the pancreas?
The pancreas is a leaf shaped organ in your body which can be found between the stomach and backbone. (picture of abdomen).  It produces substances which help aid digestion. One of these is a mixture of enzymes known as pancreatic juice which helps to break down the food you have eaten in order to provide the energy that your body needs to function in day to day life. The other main substance is a hormone known as insulin.  Insulin is produced to help maintain a relatively constant level of sugar in your blood.  

There are three main parts of the pancreas picture of pancreas:

+ the head which is the widest part of the organ nearest to the small intestine
+ the body which is the middle section of the pancreas
+ the tail which is the thinnest part at the end of the pancreas  

###This section explains what pancreatic cancer is and how it may affect you.

###What is pancreatic cancer?
Our bodies are made up of many different kinds of cells which routinely grow and divide in an organised way throughout our lifetime.  When the cells become old or fail to function properly, then they may die and new cells replace them.  This process can sometimes be derailed by changes (known as mutations) or damage to our DNA.  DNA which provides the instructions to the cells to tell them when to grow, divide or die) and instead of regulating this growth and division, the cells continue to multiply and grow in an uncontrolled manner.  The resulting growth is known as a tumour.  (simple diagram of cell growth?)

It is important to understand that not all tumours are cancerous.  Some are benign and can be removed without any lasting effects or increased risk of recurrence.  Tumours that are a risk to life are known as malignant tumours or cancer.  They have the potential to spread to other parts of the body and if they do then the cancer is described as metastatic cancer.  Sometimes malignant tumours can reoccur after the original tumour was removed.

There are many different kinds of cancer and these are normally classified by the original organ in which the uncontrolled growth began.  Pancreatic cancer describes a malignant tumour growth within the pancreas.  The most common type of pancreatic cancer occurs in the head of the pancreas.

####Types of pancreatic cancer
Just as there are many different kinds of cancer of the body, confusingly there can be different types of cancer within the same organ. 

The cells in the pancreas which produce pancreatic juice are known as exocrine cells.  A tumour originating in these cells is described as an exocrine cancer - this is the most common type of pancreatic cancer and it can occur in any part of the pancreas.  90% of exocrine pancreatic cancer is known as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This particular cancer develops in the channels, known as ducts, which carry the pancreatic juice from the pancreas into the small bowel. The remaining types of exocrine cancers are rare.

The cells which produce hormones, such as insulin, are known as endocrine cells and so tumours which originate in these cells are known as endocrine cancers.  These tumours are also referred to as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PNETS) or islet cell tumours.Â   Two thirds of malignant endocrine pancreatic cancers do not produce any hormones or symptoms.

Endocrine pancreatic tumours are treated differently to exocrine tumours and patients normally have a much better outlook (prognosis) than people diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

####Risk factors for pancreatic cancer
Many people who are diagnosed with cancer struggle to understand why they have developed cancer when other people have not.  It can be difficult to say for sure why someone develops pancreatic cancer.  However, the way that we live, such as smoking, can increase the chances of developing cancer.  This is known as a risk factor. 

From scientific studies, we know that the risk factors for pancreatic cancer include things that we can change and others that we cannot:

+ smoking
+ family history
+ pancreatitis
+ diabetes
+ obesity
+ age
+ genetic syndromes

However, sometimes people with no risk factors still develop pancreatic cancer.  This is why it is important for researchers to study pancreatic cancer in ever more detail to begin to truly understand the causes.  


###Genetic syndromes
Mutations in DNA can be passed from parent to child and sometimes these mutations can increase the risk of that child one day developing cancer or other syndromes. 

Examples of mutations in genes known to increase the risk of exocrine pancreatic cancer include:

+ PRSS1 
+ BRCA2 (also known to cause ovarian and breast cancer)
+ p16/CDKN2A (familial melanoma)
+ VHL (Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome)

Understanding which changes have occurred in the DNA of each patient before deciding on a course of treatment, can help doctors decide which therapies are most likely to provide a positive outcome.  This is known as personalised or precision medicine.
